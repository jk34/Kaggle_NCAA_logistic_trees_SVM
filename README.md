# Kaggle_NCAA_logistic_trees_SVM
My work in using machine learning algorithms on NCAA basketball tournament data. I obtained the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2015

I also utilize the blog_utility.r from https://statsguys.wordpress.com/2014/03/15/data-analytics-for-beginners-march-machine-learning-mania-part-ii/

The analysis I have performed is in ncaa.r. I have tried to use trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines to generate predictive models on previous seasons and tournament results and use the 2014 NCAA tournament results as the test data

So far, the log-loss value of .5935 for logistic regression is better than the 1.008 log-loss for rpart
